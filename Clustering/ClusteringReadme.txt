Extraction contains all scripts related to retrieving the relevant genes from specific gene ontologies, which were then matched to the readcounts from the .csv files found in RNASeqPipeline

DP_GP_cluster contains the original LICENSE and cloned files required to run the program, although it can also be retrieved by visiting their repository directly at  https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/DP_GP_cluster

The human and mouse directories contain the results of running DP_GP on our data from RNASeqPipeline
