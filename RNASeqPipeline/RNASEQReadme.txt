This folder contains all files related to the development of the RNASeq processing pipeline. This pipeline was designed specifially for processing time-course RNASeq data, but it could be easily adapted for wild-type vs diseased data, as well.

Note that any directories referred to involving /project/data are directories found on the Imperial HPC, users wishing to apply our code to their own work should substitute these elements with their own directories for proper results.

Our results of this pipeline can be found under StringTie, specifically the .csv files containing the final readcounts of the sequenced genes
